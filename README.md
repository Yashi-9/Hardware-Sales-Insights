 ### Project Overview:
 
 This project deliverers a comprehensive Sales Insights solution for AtliQ Hardware, a B2B Indian Hardware company. The primary objective was to transform raw sales data into actionable intelligence, empowering
 data-driven strategic decision-making across sales, marketing, and finance departments. The solution encompassed data engineering, advanced analytics, interactive visualizations, and a financial simulation tool.
 
 #### Problem Statement:
   
 AtliQ Hardware is currently not fully leveraging its sales data to drive strategic decision-making. This results in missed opportunities for revenue growth, profit margin improvement, and optimized customer engagement.
 
 Key challenges include:
 
 - Suboptimal sales strategies due to a lack of granular insights into product and customer performance.
 
 - Inefficient resource allocation due to insufficient understanding of regional sales patterns.
 
 - Reactive rather than proactive decision-making due to limited 'What-If' scenario planning capabilities."

    - Enhance strategic decision-making through accessible and interactive sales insights dashboards.  
    - Improve financial forecasting and planning by providing a Financial Simulator for scenario analysis.  
    - Optimize sales performance by facilitating data-backed strategies across product, customer, and market domains.
 
 2. **Stakeholders:**  
    - Sales Department  
    - Marketing Department

 Strong gains in both Brick & Mortar and E-Commerce
 
 3. **End Result:**  

    The primary deliverable of this project is a suite of interactive and automated sales analytics dashboards, accompanied by a Financial Simulator tool, designed to provide timely and actionable insights that 
    support data-driven decision-making.
 
 5. **Success Criteria:**  

    - **Decision-Making Impact:**  
    
      The sales team demonstrates improved decision-making, leading to a measurable reduction in operational costs (e.g., 10% reduction in sales-related expenses) and/or increased revenue.
    
    - **Efficiency Gains:**  

      Automation of sales analysis tasks results in a significant reduction in manual data gathering and reporting efforts (e.g., 20% time savings for the sales analysis team), allowing reallocation to strategic 
      activities.

    - **User Adoption:**  
      High user adoption of the dashboards and Financial Simulator across the defined stakeholder groups, measured by usage metrics (e.g., dashboard views, report downloads).

    - **Improved Forecast Accuracy:**  
      Increased accuracy in sales forecasts due to the insights gained from the dashboards.

### Product Analysis Dashboard:

- **Description:** Focuses on product segmentation to identify star products and underperformers.

- **Key Visuals:**

1. Segmented products based on sales and profitability to identify "star" products and "leaky" products.

2. Provided a detailed breakdown of product performance by category and individual SKU.

3. Enabled filtering and drill-down capabilities to explore product-level insights.

4. Explanation of Cluters:

   Cluster5: Indicates a niche, premium cluster that, despite low sales, carries high margins and low COGS. It should be promoted carefully.

   Cluster4: Suggests high sales with medium margins ‚Äì your key volume drivers, so efficiency is crucial.

   Cluster3: Represents hidden gems that might be underperforming in volume but offer high margins. Consider expanding their reach.

   Cluster2: Warns about clusters with low sales, negative margins even tho with low COGS; these might be candidates for discontinuation.

   Cluster1: Depicts a steady-performing segment with slight margins where there‚Äôs potential for margin improvement.
 Insights:

üîπ Sales Consistency: Clusters 1 maintained steady sales throughout the year, representing reliable performers.
Quantity mom% dec in Q2 mainly due dec in quantity in cluster 1 products

 Cluster 4 is our key drivers of sales with medium profits and cogs

Dominated by Cluster1 (51.11%) 

E-Commerce:

More balanced spread:

Cluster4 (26.74%) and Cluster5 (27.30%) together make up over 50%, indicating E-Commerce favors high-margin SKUs.

E-Commerce is a high-potential, profitable channel.
