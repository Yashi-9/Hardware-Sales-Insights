### Table of contents

### Project Overview:

This project deliverers a comprehensive Sales Insights solution for AtliQ Hardware, a B2B Indian Hardware company. The primary objective was to transform raw sales data into actionable intelligence, empowering

data-driven strategic decision-making across sales, marketing, and finance departments. The solution encompassed data engineering, advanced analytics, interactive visualizations, and a financial simulation tool.

#### Problem Statement:
  
AtliQ Hardware is currently not fully leveraging its sales data to drive strategic decision-making. This results in missed opportunities for revenue growth, profit margin improvement, and optimized customer engagement.

Key challenges include:

Suboptimal sales strategies due to a lack of granular insights into product and customer performance.

Inefficient resource allocation due to insufficient understanding of regional sales patterns.

Reactive rather than proactive decision-making due to limited 'What-If' scenario planning capabilities."

### Power BI Analysis and Dashboard

### Sales Analysis Dashboard:

1. Visualized overall sales trends, performance against targets, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

2. Employed Pareto analysis to identify top-selling products and their contribution to revenue.

3. Analyzed the correlation between sales and other business metrics to understand key drivers and inhibitors.

4. Included dynamic rolling averages to smooth out fluctuations and reveal underlying trends.

### Product Analysis Dashboard:

1. Segmented products based on sales and profitability to identify "star" products and "leaky" products.

2. Provided a detailed breakdown of product performance by category and individual SKU.

3. Enabled filtering and drill-down capabilities to explore product-level insights.

4. Explanation of Cluters:

   Cluster5: Indicates a niche, premium cluster that, despite low sales, carries high margins and low COGS. It should be promoted carefully.

   Cluster4: Suggests high sales with medium margins – your key volume drivers, so efficiency is crucial.

   Cluster3: Represents hidden gems that might be underperforming in volume but offer high margins. Consider expanding their reach.

   Cluster2: Warns about clusters with low sales, negative margins, and high COGS; these might be candidates for discontinuation.

   Cluster1: Depicts a steady-performing segment with slight margins where there’s potential for margin improvement

### Market Analysis Dashboard:

1. Visualized sales and profitability across different geographical regions using interactive maps.

2. Segmented customers within each market to understand regional customer behavior.

### Customer Analysis Dashboard:

1. Implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

2. Calculated and visualized Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and compared it with predicted CLTV to assess customer value and retention effectiveness.

3. Analyzed customer behavior patterns to inform personalized marketing and communication strategies.

### Financial Simulator:

1. Developed a dynamic "What-If" analysis tool using DAX to model the impact of changes in pricing, costs, and sales volume on profitability.

2. Enabled scenario planning to evaluate different financial strategies and optimize decision-making.
