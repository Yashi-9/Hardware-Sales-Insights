### Project Overview:

This project deliverers a comprehensive Sales Insights solution for AtliQ Hardware, a B2B Indian Hardware company. The primary objective was to transform raw sales data into actionable intelligence, empowering
data-driven strategic decision-making across sales, marketing, and finance departments. The solution encompassed data engineering, advanced analytics, interactive visualizations, and a financial simulation tool.

#### Problem Statement:
  
AtliQ Hardware is currently not fully leveraging its sales data to drive strategic decision-making. This results in missed opportunities for revenue growth, profit margin improvement, and optimized customer engagement.

Key challenges include:

- Suboptimal sales strategies due to a lack of granular insights into product and customer performance.

- Inefficient resource allocation due to insufficient understanding of regional sales patterns.

- Reactive rather than proactive decision-making due to limited 'What-If' scenario planning capabilities."

#### AIMS Grid

   The primary aim of this project is to develop and implement a data-driven sales analytics solution that empowers AtliQ Hardware to:  
   - Enhance strategic decision-making through accessible and interactive sales insights dashboards.  
   - Improve financial forecasting and planning by providing a Financial Simulator for scenario analysis.  
   - Optimize sales performance by facilitating data-backed strategies across product, customer, and market domains.

2. **Stakeholders:**  
   - Sales Department  
   - Marketing Department  
   - Finance Department  
   - Sales Operations Team  
   - Data & Analytics Department  
   - IT Department

3. **End Result:**  
   The primary deliverable of this project is a suite of interactive and automated sales analytics dashboards, accompanied by a Financial Simulator tool, designed to provide timely and actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

4. **Success Criteria:**  
   - **Decision-Making Impact:**  
     The sales team demonstrates improved decision-making, leading to a measurable reduction in operational costs (e.g., 10% reduction in sales-related expenses) and/or increased revenue.
   - **Efficiency Gains:**  
     Automation of sales analysis tasks results in a significant reduction in manual data gathering and reporting efforts (e.g., 20% time savings for the sales analysis team), allowing reallocation to strategic activities.
   - **User Adoption:**  
     High user adoption of the dashboards and Financial Simulator across the defined stakeholder groups, measured by usage metrics (e.g., dashboard views, report downloads).
   - **Improved Forecast Accuracy:**  
     Increased accuracy in sales forecasts due to the insights gained from the dashboards.

### Power BI Analysis and Dashboard

### Sales Analysis Dashboard:
- **Description:** Provides insights into sales trends, key performance indicators, and monthly sales targets.
  
- **Key Visuals:**

1. Visualized overall sales trends, performance against targets, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

2. Employed Pareto analysis to identify top-selling products and their contribution to revenue.

3. Analyzed the correlation between sales and other business metrics to understand key drivers and inhibitors.

4. Included dynamic rolling averages to smooth out fluctuations and reveal underlying trends.

- **Insights:**

1. Overall Sales Trends:

Strong Overall Sales: Total sales show a generally positive trend throughout the year, with peaks in January, July, and particularly in October and November.
Significant Drop in September: There's a notable dip in overall sales in September.
Recovery in Q4: Sales rebound strongly in the last quarter (October-December).

2. Channel Performance:

Brick & Mortar Dominance: Brick & Mortar sales (grey portion) consistently contribute the largest share of the total sales throughout the year.
E-Commerce Growth: E-Commerce sales (yellow portion) show a significant upward trend, becoming a more substantial contributor to overall sales, especially towards the end of the year.

3. Sales MoM % (Red Line): Shows significant volatility. There were substantial month-over-month growth periods (e.g., January, July, October) and significant declines (e.g., February, March, September). The highest MoM growth was in October.

4. Specific Observations:

January Surge: All three channels and all three MoM% KPIs show strong positive performance in January.
September & feb Slump: September experienced a significant downturn across bricks & motor Stores 27.5%, same with feb 16.7% and a sharp negative swing in all MoM% KPIs.
October Peak: October stands out with the highest overall sales mom Growth , driven by substantial growth in all channels and a massive surge in order volume.
E-Commerce Momentum: The increasing contribution of E-Commerce suggests a growing online customer base or successful online sales initiatives.% of Revenue
approximately 17.70% of products are responsible for 80% of revenue
The rolling average shows a smoothing effect, indicating whether recent sales are above or below the general trend."

### Product Analysis Dashboard:

- **Description:** Focuses on product segmentation to identify star products and underperformers.

- **Key Visuals:**

1. Segmented products based on sales and profitability to identify "star" products and "leaky" products.

2. Provided a detailed breakdown of product performance by category and individual SKU.

3. Enabled filtering and drill-down capabilities to explore product-level insights.

4. Explanation of Cluters:

   Cluster5: Indicates a niche, premium cluster that, despite low sales, carries high margins and low COGS. It should be promoted carefully.

   Cluster4: Suggests high sales with medium margins â€“ your key volume drivers, so efficiency is crucial.

   Cluster3: Represents hidden gems that might be underperforming in volume but offer high margins. Consider expanding their reach.

   Cluster2: Warns about clusters with low sales, negative margins, and high COGS; these might be candidates for discontinuation.

   Cluster1: Depicts a steady-performing segment with slight margins where thereâ€™s potential for margin improvement.
 Insights:

ðŸ”¹ Sales Consistency: Clusters 1 maintained steady sales throughout the year, representing reliable performers.
Quantity mom% dec in Q2 mainly due dec in quantity in cluster 1 products

   

Cluster 5 (High Margin, Low Sales): Premium, niche productsâ€”strategically promote to boost visibility.

Cluster 2 (Low Sales, Negative Margin): Candidates for discontinuation or re-pricing.
ðŸ”¹ Sales Consistency: Clusters 1 & 5 maintained steady sales throughout the year, representing reliable performers.
