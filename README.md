 ### Project Overview:
 
 This project deliverers a comprehensive Sales Insights solution for AtliQ Hardware, a B2B Indian Hardware company. The primary objective was to transform raw sales data into actionable intelligence, empowering
 data-driven strategic decision-making across sales, marketing, and finance departments. The solution encompassed data engineering, advanced analytics, interactive visualizations, and a financial simulation tool.
 
 #### Problem Statement:
   
 AtliQ Hardware is currently not fully leveraging its sales data to drive strategic decision-making. This results in missed opportunities for revenue growth, profit margin improvement, and optimized customer 
 engagement.
 
 Key challenges include:
 
 - Suboptimal sales strategies due to a lack of granular insights into product and customer performance.
 
 - Inefficient resource allocation due to insufficient understanding of regional sales patterns.
 
 - Reactive rather than proactive decision-making due to limited 'What-If' scenario planning capabilities."

 3. **End Result:**  

    The primary deliverable of this project is a suite of interactive and automated sales analytics dashboards, accompanied by a Financial Simulator tool, designed to provide timely and actionable insights that 
    support data-driven decision-making.
 
 5. **Success Criteria:**  

    - **Decision-Making Impact:**  
    
      The sales team demonstrates improved decision-making, leading to a measurable reduction in operational costs (e.g., 10% reduction in sales-related expenses) and/or increased revenue.
    
    - **Efficiency Gains:**  

      Automation of sales analysis tasks results in a significant reduction in manual data gathering and reporting efforts (e.g., 20% time savings for the sales analysis team), allowing reallocation to strategic 
      activities.

    - **User Adoption:**  
      High user adoption of the dashboards and Financial Simulator across the defined stakeholder groups, measured by usage metrics (e.g., dashboard views, report downloads).

    - **Improved Forecast Accuracy:**  
      Increased accuracy in sales forecasts due to the insights gained from the dashboards.

### Customer Analysis Dashboard:

- **Description:** Uses segmentation (RFM analysis) and predictive CLV modeling to understand customer behavior.

- **Key Visuals:**

1. Implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Each customer is scored on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) across the three dimensions:

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency: How often they purchase

Monetary: How much they spend

Based on these scores, customers are categorized into actionable segments.

2. Calculated and visualized Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and compared it with predicted CLTV to assess customer value and retention effectiveness.

3. Analyzed customer behavior patterns to inform personalized marketing and communication strategies.

Segment	     | Description

Champions                   â€“ recent, frequent, and high spenders.

Loyal Customers            	-Consistent buyers with high engagement.

High-Spending New Customers	- Recently acquired and already spending well.

Potential Loyalists         -		Early signs of becoming loyal; nurture them.

New Customers	              - 	Recently acquired, yet to build frequency.

Promising	                  -	Recent purchasers with potential for upsell.

Need Attention	             - may need re-engagement.

About to Sleep	             - Previously active, now losing interest.

At Risk	                    -	High-value customers slipping away; urgent action needed.

Cannot Lose Them	           -	Previously top-tier; win-back is crucial.

Hibernating Customers	      - Low recent engagement and value.

Lost Customers	             - Fully inactive with low lifetime value.

Other                       -	Does not match above criteria	Requires further review or segmentation refinement.

**RFM Segmentation:**
        "We have a large segment of 'Loyal Customers,' which are our most valuable customers. We should focus on retaining them."
         "The 'At Risk' segment is growing, indicating a potential problem with customer churn. We need to address this."
      **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):**
         "The average CLV is \[Amount], which is \[above/below] our target. We need to implement strategies to increase customer lifetime value."
    **Order Trends:**
        "The number of orders is declining in the \[Customer Segment], which is concerning."
